# UnrealRL-DynamicNPCs

## Description
UnrealRL-DynamicNPCs is a framework for implementing reinforcement learning models to create dynamic, adaptive NPCs in Unreal Engine. This project aims to enhance player experiences by enabling NPCs to learn and adapt their behaviors based on player interactions.

## Features
- Reinforcement learning integration with Unreal Engine
- Customizable NPC behavior models
- Flexible reward system for training NPCs
- Tools for monitoring and analyzing NPC learning progress
- Example implementations for common NPC types


## Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 4.27 or later
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch (for the RL backend)

## Installation
